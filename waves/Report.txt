The wave starts correctly memory is read and then the fsm starts
it gives the right values to the datapath and since k is one so signal kone is active(comparator from datapath)
this is supposed to drive from state 40 in hex to state 80 (image 2) however an error occured and it jumped to 
state 1 and then it gets stuck between state 2 and 4(image 3). Therefore i couldn't have an output and i wasnt able to find
the error in the code.
